### Example 2: AI Trends Research

```python
# Objective: Research AI trends and create a comprehensive report
objective = """
Research the top 3 AI trends in 2025, analyze their market impact, 
and create a detailed report with recommendations.
"""

# The Supervisor will:
# 1. Create TODO list: [Search trends, Analyze impact, Generate report]
# 2. Assign tools: [search_internet, web_scrape, write_file]
# 3. Execute each task with context from previous tasks
# 4. Generate final comprehensive report
```

### Example 3: Data Analysis Pipeline

```python
# Objective: Analyze sales data and create visualizations
objective = """
Analyze the quarterly sales data in sales_q4.csv, calculate key metrics,
create visualizations, and generate an executive summary report.
"""

# The Supervisor will:
# 1. Read and analyze the CSV file
# 2. Calculate statistics using execute_code
# 3. Create visualizations and charts
# 4. Generate executive summary report
```


## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Supervisor Loop

The Supervisor follows this workflow:

1. **Analyze Objective** - Understands the user's goal
2. **Create Plan** - Decomposes objective into TODO items using `update_todo_tool`
3. **Execute Tasks** - For each TODO item, creates a subagent using `task_tool`
4. **Collect Results** - Gathers artifacts and results from subagents
5. **Update Plan** - Refines remaining tasks based on results
6. **Iterate** - Repeats until objective is complete

### 2. Subagent Creation

Each subagent is created dynamically with:

- **Tailored Prompt** - Generated based on task requirements and context
- **Context Awareness** - Information about previous tasks and available files
- **Intelligent File Mapping** - Suggestions for relevant existing files
- **Curated Tools** - Only the tools needed for the specific task
- **Success Criteria** - Clear definition of what constitutes completion

### 3. Tool Assignment

The Supervisor intelligently assigns tools based on task requirements:

- **File Operations** - `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` for data persistence
- **Code Execution** - `execute_code` for calculations and data processing
- **Web Search** - `search_internet` for research and information gathering
- **Web Scraping** - `web_scrape` for extracting data from websites

### 4. Context Engineering

The system uses a virtual file system for context engineering:

- **Externalized Memory** - Subagents save important findings to files
- **State Persistence** - Progress and intermediate results are preserved
- **Context Passing** - Subsequent tasks can access previous work
- **Artifact Tracking** - Files created by each task are properly tracked

## 🧪 Running in LangGraph Studio

### Step 1: Install LangGraph CLI

```bash
pip install langgraph-cli
```

### Step 2: Set up your environment

```bash
# Ensure your .env file is properly configured
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key_here
```

### Step 3: Run LangGraph Studio

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd supervisor-agent

# Start LangGraph Studio
langgraph dev
```

### Step 4: Access the Studio Interface

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8123`
2. The `supervisor_agent` graph will be automatically loaded
3. Configure environment variables in the Studio interface
4. Start a new run with the sample objective

### Step 5: Test with Sample Objectives

**Create a new run with this input:**
```json
{
  "objective": "Build a product pricing analysis system: 1. Search the internet for 'average smartphone prices 2025' and save findings to market_research.txt. 2. Create prices.py with a function calculate_discount(price, percent) that returns discounted price. 3. Create product_catalog.csv with 5 smartphones: name, original_price (between $500-$1200). 4. Edit prices.py to ADD a function apply_bulk_discount(prices_list, discount_percent) that applies discount to all items. 5. Read product_catalog.csv and apply 15% discount using the functions from prices.py. 6. Generate final_report.txt that includes: Market research findings, Original product catalog, Discounted prices, Total savings, Recommendation based on market research.",
  "todo_list": [],
  "completed_tasks": [],
  "current_task": {},
  "iteration_count": 0,
  "final_result": "",
  "max_iterations": 25
}
```

### Alternative: Run Graph Programmatically

```bash
# Run the graph directly
python run_graph.py
```

This will execute the same 6-task objective that achieved our 100/100 score.
